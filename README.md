# CalC

## Intro

Hi! I am Pinak Dwivedi.

## Description

I have created this project with React Native, Expo, Expo Router, Typescript, Nativewind, TailwindCSS, React Native Reanimated.
CalC is an android calculator application with a very nice simple, and complelling UI.

## Features

Apart from having normal calculator features, CalC also has a dark-light theme mode and interactive calculation history that stays there even after you close the app, so any time you want to view your previous calculations after you closed CalC and come back, you have it on your fingertips. You can also clear the calculation history if it seems bloated to you with older calculations, and if you want to access any of your previous calculations from the history, you can do that too.

## You can find the app at
